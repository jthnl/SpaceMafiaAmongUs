# SpaceMafiaAmongUs
Final Project

## Introduction
Space Mafia Among Us is a web-based game where two teams, innocents and traitors, fight to win the game through discussion and psychological analysis. It is a social deduction game heavily inspired by the game, The Resistance: Avalon. Its nominal theme is also inspired by two very popular games: Mafia and Among Us. Each player is assigned to either team and the goal of each team is to successfully finish three out of five quests.
